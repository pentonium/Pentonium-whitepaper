# Case Study
_*Note: This is just one scenario that is being discussed. There are many more_

*User “A” wants to start a business in Blockchain. User “A” needs a number of services like solidity development, front-end development, community management, smart contract auditing, social media reach and many more. All of the services might not be available locally so User “A” starts to search people beyond any boundaries. User “A” individually contacts Users “B”, “C”, ”D” and ”E” for solidity development, community management, smart contract auditing and social media reach respectively.
