# Case Study
_*Note: This is just one scenario that is being discussed. There are many more_

User “A” wants to start a business in Blockchain. User “A” needs a number of services like solidity development, front-end development, community management, smart contract auditing, social media reach and many more. All of the services might not be available locally so User “A” starts to search people beyond any boundaries. User “A” individually contacts Users “B”, “C”, ”D” and ”E” for solidity development, community management, smart contract auditing and social media reach respectively. 

## Scenario 1
On completion of the project, everyone gets what they want. User “A” gets the fully functional business ready and Users “B”, “C”, ”D” and ”E” get what they were promised. A win-win situation for all.

_But life is not so easy. This system completely works on trust._

## Scenario 2
On completion of the project, User “A” gets what he wants and then refuses to pay what was promised to other users

## Scenario 3
User “A” has already paid certain amounts to others and they refuse to do the job.

In cases 2 and 3, there is a huge loss of time, effort and money which should be eliminated.

Pentonium has taken a step to create a trustless environment for both service providers and clients.
