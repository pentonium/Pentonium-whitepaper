## How we are user friendly

### Ranking System 
A reputation-based ranking system that helps filter out bad actors. After every successful completion of a gig, the service provider gets an upgrade in its ranking while on every lost dispute applies a downrank.


Using IPFS as the decentralized storage layer
Using IPFS as the decentralized storage layer
IPFS enables us to keep a vast variety of data to be stored separately making our contract possible to hold every single detail of the gig such as screenshots and other metadata of the job. It also helps us provide end-to-end encrypted chat service between the client and the service provider


### Escrow system
This system makes the transaction more secure by storing the required amount in the escrow wallet once the deal is locked. No one has the amount till the work is done. Problems associated with trust are resolved and thus protecting both clients and service providers from every fraudster. 


### Permissionless access to the network
There is no need to go through the registration protocol. Clients can directly browse and service providers can post their jobs just by connecting their metamask wallet. This eliminates the long process of registration and verification. It also allows service providers to get their payment instantly without any wait or minimum withdrawal limits.


### Autonomous operation
The smart-contract is designed in a way that it eliminates third parties, service providers and clients who meet one to one without any interference. In case of no dispute, the payment goes smooth to the service provider, while in case of dispute the case is resolved in a democratic way by Marshals.

### Transparent dispute resolution via voting.
A community that acts as a Marshal is resolving the dispute by voting. Every case that comes to Marshal gets voted and needs a minimum vote to be resolved. To open a case ( dispute ) clients and service providers need to pay a minimum fee.
 

### Vaults
PTM tokens can be staked in the vault, A portion of the platform's yield goes to the Vault. A person who wants to be a Marshal has to maintain a minimum of 1000 token in the vault.
