As blockchain is still in the very initial stage, it is really hard to find service providers who are interested and well versed in this stream. A platform is needed which combines a high variety of services to help one who needs all of them together to build a product.

There are many centralised platforms in the gig economy. But there are a lot of issues associated with them.
